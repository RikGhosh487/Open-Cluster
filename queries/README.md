This **directory** contains SQL queries from several public access data repositories for astrometric data collection and observation of stellar objects.

### Public Databases

The following public data repositories have been queried (Please find additional information in respective links):
- **G**lobal **A**strometric **I**nterferometer For **A**strophysics ([GAIA](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia))
    - GAIA Early Data Release 3 ([EDR3](https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/))
- **S**loan **D**igital **S**ky **S**urvey ([SDSS](https://www.sdss.org/))
    - SDSS Data Release 17 ([DR17](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr17/SearchTools/SQL/))
- The **S**et of **I**dentifications, **M**easurements and **B**ibliography for **A**stronomical **D**ata ([SIMBAD](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/))
    - SIMBAD TAP Query ([SIMTAP](http://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/sim-tap))

All queries are designed to produce `.csv` files. Other formats are not supported for the current module(s).

## Extraneous Information
The data can be further improved with the full **DR3** that is set to be released in mid 2022. That would allow us to fill the gaps present in terms of spectral information

There are other databases that could be queried for further information, but were rejected due to sufficient data found from the aforementioned databases.
